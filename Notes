Key Differences
Aspect	Gin (Go) and Spring Boot (Java)
Setup	
Go - Manual: you write each endpoint and logic	
java - SpringBoot: Automatic: Spring Actuator provides endpoints
Extensibility: 
Go - You code custom logic for health/metrics	
Java - Spring auto-discovers DB, health checks, metrics
Metrics
Go -Use libraries like prometheus/client_golang	Built-in with /actuator/metrics
Health Checks	You write DB checks (e.g. db.Ping())	
Java - Built-in, auto-checks DB if configured
Custom Checks	
Go -You code as needed	
Java - You can also add custom HealthIndicators
Language	Go	Java
Performance
Go - Compiled, lightweight, fast startup	
Java - Heavier JVM, but rich ecosystem
Deployment
Go -Single binary, easy containerization	
Java -Requires JRE, more dependencies
Summary
Gin (Go):

You have full control and must implement health and metrics endpoints yourself.
Use Go libraries for metrics (e.g., Prometheus).
Great for minimal, fast, containerized services.
Spring Boot:

Provides /actuator/health, /actuator/metrics, and more automatically.
Checks DB, caches, queues, etc., out of the box if configured.
Very rich but heavier stack; great for enterprise or complex microservices.
Bottom line:

If you want rapid, standardized health/metrics endpoints with minimal code, Spring Boot (Actuator) is more automatic.
If you want maximum control and minimal dependencies, or prefer Go, Gin is lean and efficientâ€”but you do more manually.
